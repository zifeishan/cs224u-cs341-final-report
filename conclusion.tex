In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of authorship
attribution in multi-authored documents, and focus on scientific
publications. 

The core challenges to the problem is the lack of ground truth of which authors write which parts of the publication. To address this challenge,
we devise different models include: (1) paper-level logistic regression, (2) integrating sentence-level logistic regression models, and (3) an Expectation-Maximization method to refine author models. We also propose a novel supervision method to obtain training examples.

We devise a set of stylistic features as well as content-based features, and found that paper authors can be predicted with significant accuracy by exploiting authors' stylistic idiosyncrasies.

Based on our initial studies on a synthetic dataset as well as a real-world dataset, we conclude several results: (1) sentence-level models sometimes, but not always, lead to better results. 
(2) We are able to identify authors with significant accuracy, which is more than 10 times improvement over majority class baseline. 

Our work shows great potentiality to attribute authorship in multi-authored documents, which challenges the assumption that simply removing names from a paper submission ensures anonymity in a double-blind process.
